# ROS WEB Development

## User manual

To the displayed window with the url address, enter only the IP and PORT (without ws: //), and then press _connect_ (red button). If everything is ok, the button turns green and the other buttons are no longer greyed out. At the end, we choose recommendations and that's it.

## For future development
```bash
git clone <this.repo>
cd webpages
npm install
npm start
```
